## Background

This gem is a spiritual sibling to [Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template), but specifically intended for use in Ruby/Rails environments. It does not have the same features as Consul Template; it is intended for simpler scenarios. Most importantly, leases and configuration changes are _not_ watched to automatically re-render. Consult is intended for more static or medium-to-long lived application configuration.

We use Consul Template for server level configuration, but application level configuration is more tricky. It is difficult to solve the problem of fetching configuration and secrets in a consistent way in development, staging, and production. For example, we wanted to avoid having Consul Template used in production, but some other custom solution in development.

With Consult the process is the same in all environments.

This gem is considered _beta_. At Veracross, we are just beginning to use it in staging environments.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'consult'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install consult

## Usage

Using Consult requires a configuration YAML file and a series of template files. The configuration file serves as a manifest of templates and their settings, along with optional connection settings to Vault and Consul.

Pre-existing copies of files generated by Consult (such as `secrets.yml`, `database.yml`, etc) should be removed from your app's source control and added to your `.gitignore`. Only keep your templates in source control, not the generated files!

If this gem is included in a Rails, the templates will render on Rails boot. Configuration or credential changes can be picked up by restarting your app.

### CLI

Render templates on demand with the CLI. By default, this will bypass template TTLs to force rendering and provide verbose output. See `consult --help` for options.

```bash
$ bundle exec consult
Consult: Rendered my_config
Consult: Rendered secrets
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# Optional; Consult will render this specific environment, if set
# Defaults to ENV['RAILS_ENV'] or Rails.env if Rails is present
env: test

# "shared" is the base configuration used for all environments by default
# note: you do NOT need to use yaml merge syntax to have shared configuration included for specific environments
shared:
  # Optional
  consul:
    # Prefers `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` environment variable
    address: http://0.0.0.0:8500
    # Prefers `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` environment variable, or a ~/.consul-token file.
    # Setting a token here is not best practice because consul tokens should have a relatively short TTL
    # and be read from the environment, but this is convenient for testing.
    token: 5d3f1c66-d405-4ad1-b634-ea30be4fb539

  # Optional
  vault:
    # Prefers `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable
    address: http://0.0.0.0:8200
    # Prefers `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable, or a ~/.vault-token file
    # Setting a token here is not best practice because vault tokens should have a relatively short TTL
    # and be read from the environment, but this is convenient for testing.
    token: 8fcd5aed-3eb9-412d-8923-1397af7aede2

  # Enumerate the templates.
  templates:
    database:
      # Relative paths are assumed to be in #{Rails.root}.
      # Path to the template
      path: config/templates/database.yml
      # Destination for the rendered template
      dest: config/database.yml
      # If the file is less than this old, do not re-render
      ttl: 3600 # seconds

# environment specific configuration
# NOTE: environment keys will be deep merged with the "shared" configuration
test:
  templates:
    secrets:
      path: config/templates/secrets.yml
      dest: config/secrets.yml

production:
  templates:
    # You can concatenate multiple files together
    my_config:
      paths:
        - config/templates/one.yml
        - config/templates/two.yml
      dest: config/my_config.yml

    # Templates can come from Consul
    your_config:
      consul_keys:
        - some/consul/key
        - another/consul/key
      dest: config/your_config.txt
```

### Templates

Templates files are processed with ERB. As such, they can do anything ERB can do. Consult also provides a few helper functions.

Note that under the hood, Consult is using [Diplomat](https://github.com/WeAreFarmGeek/diplomat) and the [Vault Gem](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-ruby). Consul objects are therefore Diplomat objects, and likewise Vault objects are Vault Gem objects. See their API docs for more information. Diplomat generally returns structs with title cased properties.

#### Consul Functions

**service(name)** - Fetch the nodes for the specified service.

```yaml
<% service("redis").each do |node| %>
host: <%= node.Address %>
port: <%= node.ServicePort %>
<% end %>
```

returns

    host: redis1.local
    port: 6379

**query(name_or_id, options: nil)** - Execute the specified prepared Query by name or ID

```ruby
<% query('pg-production').tap do |result| %>
  service: <%= result.Service %>
  nodes:
  <% result.Nodes.each do |node| %>
    address: <%= node['Node']['Address']
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

**query_nodes(name_or_id, options: nil)** - Return only the nodes from a prepared query

```yml
<% query_nodes('pg-production').each do |node| %>
<%= node['Node'] %>:
  host: <%= node['Address'] %>
  datacenter: <%= node['Datacenter'] %>
<% end %>
```

    pg1:
      host: 10.0.100.101
      datacenter: us-east-1
    pg2:
      host: 10.0.100.102
      datacenter: us-east-2

**key(key, options: nil, not_found: :reject, found: :return)** - Return value of the given key

```yml
'<% key('apps/infrastructure/node/dns') %>':
<<: *common
  host: <%= key('apps/infrastructure/node/dns') %>
  port: 1433
```

    'db1':
    <<: *common
      host: db1
      port: 1433

#### Vault Functions

**secret(path)** - Fetch a secret at the given path.

    # Vault KV v2
    username: <%= secret('secret/data/credentials').data.dig(:data, :username) %>

    # Vault KV v1
    username: <%= secret('secret/credentials').data[:username] %>

yields

    username: kylo.ren

**secrets(path)** - List all secrets at the given path

```ruby
<% secrets('secret').each do |path| %>
  <%= path %>
<% end %>
```

yields

    foo
    bar
    baz

#### Utility Functions

**timestamp** - Renders the current utc timestamp.

    <%= timestamp %>

renders

    2018-02-23 14:20:29 UTC

**indent(string, level, separator = '\n')** - Indents a multi-line string by `level`

```yml
keys:
  multi_line: |
<%= indent secret('secret/keys/multi_line).data[:value], 4 %>
```

renders

```yml
keys:
  multi_line: |
    30ada39cccf79aadbd1d870bc15f0086
    7ea8d734e81e9c6710faa15b0aff516c
    27778ab3b1e10db2028352f12c3c07bb
    e7ec40d1e45834681b4dc3548230d1ca
```

**with(whatever)** - takes `whatever` and yields it back. Equivalent to `tap`, but provided as a bridge from [Consul Template]/Go template conventions.

```yml
<% with secret "secrets/credentials" do |s| %>
username: <%= s.data[:username] %>
password: <%= s.data[:password] %>
<% end %>
```

#### More Full Examples

Render multiple servers into a `database.yml` file, keyed by their name.

```yml
# database.yml
<% service("postgres").each do |node| %>
'<%= node.Node %>':
  host: <%= node.Address %>
  port: <%= node.ServicePort %>
  <%- with secret "secret/base/sql-server/#{node.Node}/web" do |s| -%>
  # Credential lease good until <%= (timestamp + s.lease_duration).to_s %>
  username: <%= s.data[:username] %>
  password: <%= s.data[:password] %>
  <% end -%>
<% end %>
```

Yields something like

```yml
# database.yml
'db1':
  host: 10.0.100.101
  port: 5432
  # Credential lease good until 2018-02-24 16:08:29 UTC
  username: foo
  password: bar
'db2':
  host: 10.0.100.102
  port: 5432
  # Credential lease good until 2018-02-24 16:08:29 UTC
  username: baz
  password: qux
```

#### Secrets

```yml
# secrets.yml
shared:
  rollbar_token: <%= secret('secrets/third_party').data[:rollbar] %>
  scout_token: <%= secret('secrets/third_party').data[:scout] %>

development:
  secret_key_base: abcd1234....

production:
  secret_key_base: <%= secret('secret/apps/myapp').data[:secret_key_base] %>
```

Then reference secrets in your app with `Rails.application.secrets`.

```ruby
# config/intiializers/rollbar.rb
Rollbar.configure do |config|
  config.access_token = Rails.application.secrets.rollbar_token
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. See below for testing instructions.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Testing

Testing is easiest by running Consul and Vault in Docker. Just boot up their minimal containers:

    $ docker-compose up

Then run `bundle exec rspec`, or `bundle exec guard`.
